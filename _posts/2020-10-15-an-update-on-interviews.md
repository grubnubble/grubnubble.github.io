For the past two weeks, I’ve been conducting informal interviews, and I’ve been humbled by the abundance of ideas that each person has. Sometimes, the ideas that come up are things that I have thought about before, but often the ideas are completely new to me. This is the power of reaching out to others, of leaning on other people, and of building community. I hope that this is just the beginning of a rich collaboration for this theater. 

I was originally going to write up a single blog post that summarized all of the things I learned from the interviews, but that seems less tenable at this point. In each interview, I am learning an incredible amount of information about so many varying topics, from distribution to community engagement to business plans and funding to post-COVID industry adaptations. There is just too much to try to summarize into a single post. 

For that reason, I’m going to be writing more posts about interviews. I don’t think that each interview will have a corresponding blog post, but some posts might only cover a single interview. Some posts might address multiple interviews. This is all very much a learning process, so we’ll see where it goes.

I’m finding personally that I tend to get very anxious before talking to a new person, but once the conversation gets to cooperatives, community, or movies, all pressure melts away. People _love_ talking about this stuff, and so do I. There have been a few days when I felt discouraged or overwhelmed by this project, but talking to other people about it alleviates those fears. Whatever comes up, there will be someone that knows how to figure it out. If it’s not me, I’ll ask a friend. If it’s not a friend, maybe one of their friends. Again and again I am reminded to trust in the power of people and community. There is more strength in community than in any single individual. That’s what this is all about.
