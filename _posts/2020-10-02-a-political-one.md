I first became a Marxist in 2015. It wasn’t the culmination of a long history of radical politics. It wasn’t after I had weighed the ideas philosophically and spent hours reading theory to convince myself that it was correct. I became a Marxist because without thinking too much about it, it made sense. 

The more I learned over the years, the more sense it made. Learning about class divisions and class interests changed my perspective on how to face the world, and it was consistent with my experience as a member of the working class. It wasn’t easy to learn what dialectical materialism is or to reframe how I think about environmentalism and feminism (two things that were very important to me at the time and continue to be now). But the upshot is that I feel more confident and optimistic about a future in which increasing the quality of life for all people is a reason in itself for working, innovating, and getting up in the morning. I’m motivated to be a Marxist because I believe in the inherent beauty and goodness of humanity.

Maybe a year after I became a Marxist I had a Big Idea to write a book. I have a hard time reading Marx, and many books on Marxism (not only Marx’s) are translated from other languages that have more convoluted sentence structures than English. And many of them are just old. It’s not easy to pick up any book written in 1848, let’s be real. The ideas in these books are still very much relevant, but they aren’t the easiest to read. I wanted to distill the important ideas of Marxism down into a short, easily-digestible book that was accessible and precise, losing none of the important aspects that make Marxism such a robust tool for understanding history and dynamics of power. For a long time, I didn’t think I was knowledgeable enough to write a book like that. I also had trouble getting motivated and, frankly, taking myself seriously.

What I wanted, though, was not the clout of having written a book. I do want to one day write a book as a life goal/bucket list item, but the book on Marxism was something different. I wanted it as a resource to refer people to, a tool to make it a little easier for others to learn what I had taken me significant effort to learn. While I never got the project off the ground, I’m now happy to say that I don’t have to! I found a book that is exactly what I was hoping to write, complete with corny jokes and political nuance. Ironically (is this irony?) it was published right around the same time that I first got the idea to write a book like it. The book is _Socialism...seriously_, written by Danny Katch.

For me, 2020 has been the year of bookclubs. I attended my very first bookclub in January, and now I consistently find myself active in 5-7 separate bookclubs at any given time. Reading has been my coping mechanism this year. It helps that I have also spent the past year and a half weaning myself off of social media. Without Facebook and Instagram keeping me busy, I found that I have a lot more time on my hands. I’ve been using that time to read.

In one of the newer bookclubs, we decided to go with a “Left of Liberal” theme. The members of this bookclub are looking for more radical politics, but haven’t had much exposure to anything left of liberalism. Katch’s book was chosen as our first book after one member looked up the top rated books about socialism on Amazon and chose one with a lower page count. Initially, I thought I was going to be holding myself back from criticizing the book, thinking the author probably wouldn’t be clear about certain key characteristics of socialism (for example, the need to overthrow the current ruling class, the fundamental ties between socialism and communism, etc). I had to eat a slice of humble pie though because as I said before, _Socialism…seriously_ has some genuine chomps. If you are interested at all in more leftist thinking, I recommend you read this book. It’s somehow dense yet has breath. The way it’s written is approachable and yet he packs in _so much_ information.

You can buy the book [here](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/740-socialism-seriously), which is the publisher’s site. I plan to add a link to this book in my About section as well, so if you decide later that you want to read it, you won’t have to search my as-yet-unsearchable posts for this book title.
