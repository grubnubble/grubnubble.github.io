I want to start this blog because I tend to have ambitious ideas, and while I love the brainstorming process, when it comes to making an idea real, I struggle. I know, I am completely alone in this. No one else could *possibly* have staggering anxiety at the prospect of committing to something new.

I think part of the reason is that I don’t believe that my ideas are worth pursuing, which reflects more on my own self-worth and self-esteem than anything to do with the merit of the idea. It is a reality about myself that I want to face in a straightforward way. My big idea right now is to start an independent movie theater in South Philadelphia -- one with an emphasis on connecting to the community and on holding special and unusual events. I have been thinking about and discussing and making notes on this idea for a movie theater, but it is entirely possible that it may not happen. If it doesn’t happen, I want to document the process and hope that I have for it now.

I’d like to address the title of this blog, since it may prompt some questions. While I believe that my political views are important and shape my thoughts, I don’t really want to dwell on them here. Instead I will just say simply that I am a communist. And by that I mean that I believe the workings of the government and industry should be collectively owned by the people, that eventually (past any of our lifetimes) we will no longer need a State, and that democracy is an essential part of this process. I do believe in the necessity for a revolution since to get from where we are now, where the government and industry are owned by powerful elites, to where I hope one day we can be, there must be a change of hands of power. This, by definition, is what a revolution is.

I won’t likely bring up my politics much after this, but I state that I am a communist because I want to provide an example of the kind of person a communist can be. With that, I’d like to come back to the initial, formative thoughts and goals I have for this South Philly movie theater.

**Why South Philly?**

I’m looking at South Philly right now because it’s the area of the city that I’m most familiar with. I moved to Philadelphia in 2016 and besides a brief year in West Philly, I have always lived in South Philly. South Philly is also a vague enough area that it doesn’t confine the location of the theater by too much. I think of South Philly as anything south of Washington, but I know not everyone agrees on that. Before I find an exact location, I would like to conduct some research by knocking on doors, hoping residents will answer their doors, and asking them some questions. 
What do you think about having a movie theater in the neighborhood?
Is this a place you can see yourself going to?
What thoughts and opinions do you have about it?
What would you like to see in a movie theater in your neighborhood?
Do you have any concerns with having a movie theater nearby?

I’m sure there will be more questions to ask. The point is that I want input from the residents, and I want to see what other ideas they might have for this.  I would like to make sure I am not just creating a movie theater in a vacuum. Part of why I want to create this theater is because I want to listen to people and incorporate their ideas where it makes sense. I genuinely believe that connecting with others is the best way to make an enterprise like this robust and meaningful. I hope that by interviewing local residents and using their ideas, community members will feel like they have a stake in the business, that they will feel like it belongs to them, too.

**Business Model**

To keep on the theme of being oriented to community and because I believe strongly in workers’ rights, this theater will be a workers’ cooperative. I have a lot of research to do on what type of co op and how to make this happen, but the main idea is that the workers will own the movie theater. There will be no CEO. The hierarchy of the business will be much flatter than most companies. The workers will make business decisions together. My hope is that all full time workers make the same amount of money and any workers who do not wish to be owners make at least $15 an hour. 

**Landmark**

In Philadelphia, we already have a number of theaters that play new independent films, documentaries, and foreign films. They are collectively called the Ritzes, and go by different names according to their locations. They offer pastries at the concession stand, can be rented for private screenings, and each year they host the Philadelphia Film Festival. In other words, the corner on indie theaters in Philly is well covered. But since 2007, these theaters are not as a business what one could consider “independent.” They are part of the Landmark Theater chain, and are therefore restricted to Landmark’s rules. They also are a lot more powerful in the theater business since Landmark has long established relationships with film distributors and plenty of capital to support the Ritzes. 

For these reasons, it makes sense to prevent competition with Landmark. That’s why the theater in South Philly will not play the newest releases. Instead, we will play films that are no longer playing in theaters. They could range from old black and white silent films to movies that came out just a few years ago. I am hoping that this will prevent any bad blood between our theater and the Ritzes, but again, I will need to do more research, talk to more people, and ask more questions.

**Next Steps**

I have a vague timeline for the next few months. In August, my goal was to come up with some general questions to ask people who are co op owners or who are involved with small, indie movie theaters. My second August goal was to create a blog. Ta da! Here is my blog!

In September, I would like to start interviewing people, taking notes, and writing a few blog posts on my progress. I may write up a separate post of the initial timeline so that I don’t bog this post down with too many details just yet.

If you have ideas for questions to ask nearby residents, questions to ask coop members and folks in the independent movie theater business, or have connections to people and coops that might help, please get in touch by emailing montana@acsab.com.
