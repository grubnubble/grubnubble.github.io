There is a book that was published this year called [Stardust to Stardust](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1598-stardust-to-stardust-reflections-on-living-and-dying) by Erik Olin Wright which is a compilation of [his blog posts](https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/erikolinwright) that he kept while he was being treated for cancer. Erik Olin Wright is a well known sociologist, but I hadn’t read anything that he wrote before I read Stardust to Stardust.

While most of the book covers personal subjects, he does talk about sociology a bit, including his work on what he calls Real Utopias. This idea has been stuck in my head for months now. I am not exactly sure I know what it is, but I do think that I get the general idea. I think it’s as close to a utopia that we can get. People are able to function autonomously, they feel that they have a meaningful role, and they are supported. In other words, they have what they need to survive, and they also have what they need to thrive. I’d like the theater to be a Real Utopia in this sense.

There are certain times in my life that I can look back on and experience a sense of satisfaction about the entire episode of my life. In each of these periods, there was a physical location that facilitated a sense of community and was able to bring people together in a way where they felt some ownership of the place. My own sense of being supported by others during those times has been heavily dependent on those physical spaces. I think that the sensation of feeling supported, of having a sense of autonomy and the ability to give back to a group was what Erik Olin Wright was getting at with his Real Utopias. My hope is that the movie theater will also provide this very necessary function.

I want there to be a sense of generosity at the theater, where people give because they want to see the theater succeed, not because they are coerced into it. Maybe the theater can offer a respite from the feeling of desperation and isolation that we as a society seem to be living in almost constantly.

Even as I’ve been collecting notes on interviews and doing research for the theater, I have felt a growing sense of calmness, sureness, and a tentative hope in the theater’s future. It is already for me a space for the kind of thoughtful excitement that I hope the theater will one day embody.
