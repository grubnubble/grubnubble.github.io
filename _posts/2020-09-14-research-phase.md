A few weeks ago, I wrote up an outline for what I would like to accomplish for the theater for the rest of the year. It certainly doesn’t make sense to try to open a business that depends on many people being inside, sitting next to each other in an enclosed space during a pandemic. I figured it is a good time to put effort into research so that I have a strong foundation when the time comes to start raising capital and finding a location. An added bonus is that an extended time for research will help me foster relationships with people who want to get involved. It’s also a great opportunity to drum up support for the theater so that it has the best chance of success when it opens.

I took the main, kind of vague goal for “research” and broke it up into smaller goals so that I would have some focus for each month. In August, my goal was to get a blog site up and running. I wasn’t sure what that would look like -- if I would use an existing site like Medium or create something a bit more DIY. I ended up using Jekyll to create the site and am hosting it through GitHub with a custom domain. Part of the reason I went this route was because I was concerned about the potential for paywalls and clandestine data collection if I used a third party. 

I also like that I have complete control over my site. I had never used Jekyll to set up a website before. It was a bit of a learning curve, but it was fun to learn. It was also a challenge to set up the custom domain and get a custom email for the site. My favorite part was drawing the sleeping cat which serves as my logo for now.

I didn’t get all of my goals for August completed, but I am satisfied with what I did get done. Here is my original list that I made at the beginning of August.

**August**
* Compile a list of people to talk to about their experiences: people who have started independent theaters, folks who are involved with cooperatives, people involved with local business organizations
* Compile a list of questions to ask these people
* Set up the blog
* Make the first blog post

**September**
* Start scheduling interviews
* Collect data and determine what further action that data requires
* Write second blog post
* Consider how COVID-19 will affect this project
* Compile a list of questions to ask in neighborhoods

**October**
* Research loans for real estate
* Start conducting neighborhood research
* Revisit goals for November and December

I decided that I would probably learn enough in my interviews that they could guide my goals for November and December. I’ve already had one interview, and it was all about co-ops! It turns out that I have a lot to learn on that front.

More on co-ops in the next post.
