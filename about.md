I've got plans for an independent movie theater in South Philly. This is where I'll document my hopes, ambitions, and fears.

I call myself a communist because I believe we can one day live in a classless, stateless society. That's communism. I call myself a socialist because getting from our current capitalist predicament to the uplifting world of communism will require a period of transition, where we will still have money but the means of production and the state will be democratically controlled by the workers. That is socialism. I call myself a Marxist because I believe in looking at the past through the perspective of class struggle, and I believe that improving material conditions for the working class is the most important goal.
